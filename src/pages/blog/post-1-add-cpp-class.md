description: How to add a new c++ class to our project.
---
*For this tutorial we are using the standard first person C++ template with starter content*

To add a new c++ class to your project, first right click and then select `New C++ class`. Then select the Parent Class you want to inherent from. In most of my tutorials we inherent from the Actor class. Next, name and set the location path of your class.

For this tutorial I named my actor `MyActor` and set the default path to what was provided by the engine.
